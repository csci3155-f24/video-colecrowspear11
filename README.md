Introduction To Recursion in Python

## Description

In this mini-project, we explore the concept of recursion through a simple Python program that computes the Fibonacci sequence. This project aims to reinforce fundamental programming concepts, demonstrate the differences between recursion and iteration, and illustrate how recursion applies to a well-known mathematical sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example often used to introduce recursion, as each term in the sequence (after the first two) depends on the two preceding terms. By writing a recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers, we examine the recursive call structure, discuss its efficiency and readability trade-offs compared to iteration, and explore how these concepts translate across different programming languages.

In addition, while Python is a dynamically typed language, this project also offers a brief comparison to Scala, a statically typed language explored in our course. Despite the typing differences, the core recursive logic remains conceptually the same, highlighting recursion as a language-agnostic concept.
